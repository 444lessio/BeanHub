# BeanHub - UniPA Coffee App ‚òï

This project is the first assignment for the Big Data course at the University of Palermo (UniPA).
It is a web application built with **Spring Boot** and **Thymeleaf**, laying the groundwork for a smart coffee vending machine management platform.

The application is designed to handle 4 different user roles, each with its own dedicated interface and functionalities.
